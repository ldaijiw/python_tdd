# Test Driven Development

Normally with software development, code is written and then tested. With TDD specific unit tests are constructed first, and then the code is written to pass these tests. Only when the code has passed every test is it approved and refactored.

Tests can give developeres the confidence when refactoring code, as they are more likely to catch bugs due to the instant feedback when tests are executed.
